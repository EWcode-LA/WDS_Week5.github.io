// WorkDay Scheduler

// =================

// It displays 9-5 shift for the current day

// It shows the day of the week and the date

// It's a list of reminders or events

// Each row represents a specific time during business hours (9am-5pm)

// Times that are in the past are grayed out

// Current hour is in red

// Future times are in green

// When I click on a row that is not in the past, I can enter an event

  // for that specific hour
  
// There's a save button on the right side of the time block

// Events are stored in local storage.

  // NOTE: we save in local storage so that we can persist the events
  
  // even if we refresh the page, of if I close the brwoser window
  
  // and open the app again.
